### About the Experiment 

Compression strength test for moulding sand: Compression test determines the bonding or adhesiveness power of various bonding materials in green sand. 
Tensile strength test of core sand: During casting the core is placed inside the mould and the molten metal is poured in to the cavity. As the molten metal begins to cool, it begins to contract on the inner radius as well as the outer radius. Due to the contraction of the inner radius the core sand will be pulled outwards causing a tensile load around the core. Hence knowledge of tensile strength of core sand is important.
Shear strength test for moulding sand: The moulding sand must possess sufficient strength to permit the mould to be formed to the desired shape and to retain the shape even after the hot metal is poured into the mould cavity.

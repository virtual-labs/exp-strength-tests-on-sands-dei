### To perform various strength test on core and mould sand

I. 	 Compression strength test for moulding sand<br>
II.  Shear strength test for moulding sand<br>
III. Tensile strength test of core sand

### Learning Objectives:

LO1- To understand the Importance of Sand Strength Tests – significance of compression, tensile, and shear strength in moulding and core sand to ensure defect-free castings.

LO2- To analyse the Testing Procedures – Performing compression, tensile, and shear strength tests using a universal sand testing machine while following standard procedures.

LO3- To understand Factors Affecting Sand Strength –how moisture content, binder percentage, grain size, and compaction pressure influence the mechanical strength of moulding and core sand.

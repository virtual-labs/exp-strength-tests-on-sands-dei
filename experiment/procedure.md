### Compression strength test for moulding sand
*Take weighed proportions of sand and clay and dry mix them together in a Muller for 3 minutes. 
*Adjust the weight of the sand to get standard specimen 
*Remove the standard specimen by the stripper and place it between shackles which are fixed in the sand testing machine. 
*Rotate the handle of the testing machine to actuate the ram. Thus, hydraulic pressure is applied continuously till the specimen raptures. 
*Read the compression strength from the gauge and record the same. 
*Conduct the experiment for the above said two cases and tabulate the result.


###Tensile strength test of core sand
*Take proper proportions of base sand and binder then mix them together thoroughly. 
*Assemble the core box and fill the mixture into it
*Place the core box under sand rammer and ram the sand thrice
*Using a wooden piece tap the core box gently from sides. Remove the core box leaving the rammed core on a flat metal plate 
*Bake the specimen (which is on a plate) for about 30 minutes at a temperature of 150O â€“ 200O C in an oven. (When the binder is core oil)
*If the binder is sodium silicate, pass Co2 gas for 5 secs. The core hardens instantly and the core can be directly used.
*Fix the tension shackles on to the sand testing machine, and place the hardened specimen in the shackles
*Apply the load gradually by turning the hand wheel of the testing machine. Note down the readings when the specimen breaks. 
*Repeat the procedure for the different percentage of binder and tabulate the readings


###Shear strength test for moulding sand
*Take weighed amount of foundry sand (mixture of sand, clay & water as specified). 
*Transfer the sand mixture into the tube and ram it with the help of a sand rammer thrice. 
*Fix the shackles to the universal sand testing machine
*Remove the specimen from the tube with the help of a stripper and load it into the universal sand testing machine. 
*Apply the hydraulic pressure by rotating the handle of the universal sand testing machine continuously until the specimen ruptures. 
*Read the shear strength directly from the scale and tabulate the readings.

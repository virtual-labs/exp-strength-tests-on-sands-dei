      "explanations": {
        "a": "In foundry operations, the minimum wet tensile strength that is typically maintained for green sand Moulds is around 25 gm/sq cm (grams per square centimeter).      This strength is important to ensure that the Mould can withstand the stresses during casting and handling without breaking or deforming.",

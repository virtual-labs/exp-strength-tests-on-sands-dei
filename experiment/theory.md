### Compression strength test for moulding sand
 
1. Itâ€™s a test that has to be performed periodically 
2. Moulding sand constitutes of silica sand, clay, water and other special additives.
3. Clay imparts necessary binding strength to the sand in wet state.
4. Compression test determines the bonding or adhesiveness power of various bonding materials in green sand.
5. The green compressive strength of foundry sand is the maximum compression strength a mixture is capable of developing when it is in most condition.


### Tensile strength test of core sand

1. A core is compacted sand mass of a known shape.
2. When a hallow casting is required, a core is used in the mould or when a complex contour is required a mould is created out of cores.
3. Core boxes are used for making cores. They are either made single or in two parts. Their classification is generally according to the shape of the core or the method of making the core.
4. Split core box is very widely used and is made in two parts, which can be joined together by means of dowels to form the complete cavity for making the core.
5. The purpose of adding binder to the moulding sand is to impart strength and cohesiveness to the sand to enable it to retain its shape after the core has been rammed.
6. During casting the core is placed inside the mould and the molten metal is poured in to the cavity. As the molten metal begins to cool, it begins to contract on the inner radius as well as the outer radius. Due to the contraction of the inner radius the core sand will be pulled outwards causing a tensile load around the core. Hence knowledge of tensile strength of core sand is important.


### Shear strength test for moulding sand

1. Shear strength is the ability of sand particles to resist the shear stress and to stick together.
2. Insufficient Shear strength may lead to the collapsing of sand in the mould or its partial destruction during handling. The mould and core may also be damaged during flow of molten metal in the mould cavity.
3. The moulding sand must possess sufficient strength to permit the mould to be formed to the desired shape and to retain the shape even after the hot metal is poured into the mould cavity.
4. In shearing, the rupture occurs parallel to the axis of the specimen.

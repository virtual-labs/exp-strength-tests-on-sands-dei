      "question": "What is the primary purpose of conducting a compression strength test on moulding sand? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To determine the moisture content",
        "b": "To evaluate the ability of sand to resist compressive forces",
        "c": "To measure the thermal conductivity of the sand",
        "d": "To check the grain size distribution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Compression strength testing ensures that the moulding sand can withstand the forces exerted by molten metal without collapsing. If the sand has low compressive strength, the mould may deform or crack, leading to casting defects. Higher compression strength means better load-bearing capability, ensuring the stability of the mould during metal pouring.",

      "question": "What is the standard method of compacting the sand mixture in the compression strength test? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By heating the sand",
        "b": "By manually pressing it into a mould",
        "c": "By ramming the sand with a sand rammer",
        "d": "By vibrating the sand mixture"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A sand rammer is used to apply uniform pressure to the sand specimen, ensuring consistent density and strength. This process eliminates air gaps and provides accurate test results. If the sand is not compacted properly, it may produce weak moulds that cannot withstand metal casting pressures.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The universal sand testing machine applies controlled force to the sand specimen until failure occurs. It provides precise measurements of shear strength, helping determine the suitability of sand mixtures for foundry applications. Proper calibration of the machine is essential for accurate readings.",
        "b": "The universal sand testing machine applies controlled force to the sand specimen until failure occurs.

        "d": "By measuring the weight of the sand specimen"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The universal sand testing machine gradually applies force to the specimen until it breaks. The reading at which rupture occurs is the shear strength, indicating the sand's ability to withstand mechanical stresses.",
        "b": "The universal sand testing machine gradually applies force to the specimen until it breaks. The reading at which rupture occurs is the shear strength, indicating the sand's ability to withstand mechanical stresses.",
